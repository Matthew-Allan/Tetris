## My attempt at creating Tetris.
Created with SDL2 and OpenGL in C.

Currently only supports Mac. If compiling, you will need to have SDL2 installed using Homebrew.

This can be done as so:
```
brew install SDL2
```
Otherwise the release can be downloaded from the GitHub page [https://github.com/Matthew-Allan/Tetris/releases/tag/v1.0.0].

Controls:
- `A`: Move left
- `D`: Move right
- `Q`: Rotate left
- `E`: Rotate right
- `Space`: Instant drop
